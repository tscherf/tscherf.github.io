**What is the problem?**
To increase the Security in communication between LDAP clients and Microsoft
Active Directory domain controllers (AD DC), in August 2019 Microsoft
published the [Advisory
190023](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-us/vulnerability/ADV190023).
With the changes announced in this advisory, unsigned LDAP connections are not
longer allowed when talking to Microsoft AD DC. This does not necessarily mean
that all communication has to go through a TLS-Channel on port 636 or 389 when
startTLS is used. Instead clients can also use SASL with GSSAPI or
GSSAPI-SPNEGO to encrypt and/or sign the connection. In this case the
communication also still goes over the default LDAP port 389.

Additionally Microsoft announced in this advisory, that LDAP channel binding
has to be used in case a TLS-channel is established between the client and the
AD DC. This helps to prevent spoofing and replay attack because it's binding
the transport layer and the application layer together. This basically means
you can not intercept the LDAP communication and inject it in a different
TLS-connection.

Linux clients library cyrus-sasl and OpenLDAP were updated in early 2020 to
support LDAP channel binding.

**Status (Feb 2020) - Channel Binding enforced but not (yet) supported on Linux side**

**Updates**

Upstream work to support channel-bindings for LDAP over TLS:
[cyrus-sasl](https://github.com/cyrusimap/cyrus-sasl/issues/600)
[OpenLDAP](https://bugs.openldap.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9189)
